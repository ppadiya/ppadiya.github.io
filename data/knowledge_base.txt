I used to have the same feeling every year during my annual appraisal meetings with my manager. In recent years, I started organizing emails with specific details into a dedicated folder—it’s been a game changer for tracking accomplishments and providing clear examples when needed.

# Fake Posts - Asking for Likes, Comments, Mobile No. Etc

SAMPLE PARAGRAPHS (first 10):
1. Created on 2015-01-19 05:29

2. Published on 2015-01-19 05:29

3. I have seen a lot of posts where a user mentions of some or the other opening/vacancy and asks for viewers/readers to like and or comment. I feel it is a cheap stunt to gain some visibility on Social Media (LinkedIn) and improve ranking (Don't understand the joy they get in doing so).

4. If I am a recruiter and need candidates, I would share my email ID and or contact number so people can share their CV and call me for that opening. I DEFINITELY WONT be going through thousands of profiles who have liked the post or commented something like "I am interested, consider me, view my profile etc". if you just like the comment, the person wont be able to see your profile anyways unless he/she is added as connection or security settings of your profile is set to display your complete profile to everyone on LinkedIn (and not restricted to your connections)

5. In another instance, I have come across a post where user is asking for mobile number and creating some sort of group (Eg: group where jobs will be posted etc) on whatsapp. MOST IMPORTANTLY, it mentions that it is for HR professionals only and we HR can share our openings. If I am HR professional, What will I do knowing the opening/vacancy in other companies?? Instead if it was to ask Job Seekers to join the group, it might make some sense.

6. Again, there are thousands of comments with mobile numbers mentioned. What kind of technology is that user using to accommodate these many number of people on whatsapp group?? Why do you even give your number when you see more than 100 comments already there. Instead now your personal number is Public and can be misused or sold to marketing companies and you start receiving telemarketing calls and maybe more trouble!!

7. There could be some genuine/newbie recruiters who would have posted an opening/ vacancy without sharing their contact details too. I would recommend recruiters to share atleast an email address for people to share their resumes instead of asking for their contact details/comments and likes.

8. There could be more such scams or fake posts. Lets be wise and think before we blindly follow any post. Understand it by carefully observing and only then choose to share your contact details. I would say send them a message instead of making your personal contact details public. You can always check the company name and search online for the company website and their boardline and get in touch with the user who posted the opening.

9. P.S. - This is my personal observation and opinion.
